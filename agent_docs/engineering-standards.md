# Engineering Standards

These principles are stack-agnostic. The concrete tool or command that
implements each one for THIS project's stack lives in CLAUDE.md's Commands
section or in `.claude/rules/` — this file explains the "why," not the
"which linter."

- **Correctness over speed.** Prefer a solution that's verifiably correct
  over one that's merely fast to write.
- **Type safety where the language supports it.** Use the strictest
  practical type-checking configuration for the chosen language.
- **Readability and maintainability are not optional.** Code is read far
  more often than written. Favor clear naming and small, single-purpose
  functions/modules over clever compression.
- **Performance matters only where it's measured to matter.** Don't
  micro-optimize blindly. Apply the performance practices standard for
  this specific language/runtime — these vary significantly by stack, so
  the concrete guidance lives in `.claude/rules/` scoped to the relevant
  paths, not duplicated here as generic advice.
- **Automated validation before every push.** Linting, type-checking, and
  tests should run automatically — not rely on a human or the AI
  remembering to run them manually. See `.claude/hooks/` for how this is
  enforced for real, not just requested in prose.
- **Test-driven bug fixes.** When fixing a bug, first write a failing test
  that reproduces it, then fix the code until the test passes. This
  prevents regressions and documents the bug for future readers.
- **Follow current, real documentation — not memorized patterns.** When
  implementing anything non-trivial with a library or framework, check
  that library's current official docs rather than relying on
  potentially outdated training knowledge; APIs and recommended patterns
  change between versions.
- **No unexplained magic.** Anything non-obvious (a workaround, a
  performance trick, an unusual dependency) gets a short comment
  explaining why, not just what.
- **Don't write in prose what a linter can enforce.** Formatting, import
  order, and other deterministic style rules belong in the linter/formatter
  config, not as instructions here. Prose rules are for judgment calls a
  linter can't make (e.g. "prefer composition over inheritance here
  because—").
